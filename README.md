**Virtualenv should be part of python, if you don't have it you can install the virtualenv by `pip3.9 install virtualenv` or `python3.8 -m venv venv`

Type `python3.9 -m venv venv` or `python3.8 -m venv venv` to create virtualenv

Then type `venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1` in order to activate virtualenv

Make sure there is `(.venv)` before path in powershell
